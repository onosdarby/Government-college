                    Government College Ughelli was founded in 1945. It was sited initially at Warri and was known as Warri Middle School, before it was later moved to Ughelli. The First Students (Mariners) walked into their classrooms on January 19, 1945. Modeled after its remarkable “Public Schools” contemporaries in Britain, Government College Ughelli was conceived as an institution where students were brought up to appreciate the virtues of manliness, sportsmanship, intellectual and moral excellence, integrity and of a clean and salubrious environment. However, especial care was taken to ensure that the character of the student was molded without their personality being distorted.</P>
